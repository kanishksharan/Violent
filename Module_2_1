File Systems in python:

# Write/create file

fwriter = open("python_written.txt","w")
for count in range(1,200,2):
    fwriter.write(str(count)+"\n")
fwriter.close()



# Append to file

fwriter = open("python_written.txt","a")
fwriter.write(str("Now we shall print the even number only\n"))
for count in range(0,201,2):
    fwriter.write(str(count)+"\n")
fwriter.close()

# Read from file

fwriter = open("python_written.txt","r")
for lines in fwriter.readlines():
    print(lines.strip()) # This will remove "\n"
fwriter.close()

#Rename file

import os
os.rename("python_written.txt","renamed_written.txt")
