# What are signals ?
# All ow you to handle asynchronous ebents properly
# For example: to terminate a process from the keyboard, we send a "kill -9 signal" that process is called SIGKILL
# To get a comprehensive list of signals use : "man 7 signal"

# Import signal
# Write a signal handler
# A simple program wherein, if we hit "ctrl+c" to kill a signal then the process should not terminate immediately.
# After that provide the signal number: SIGINT
# Other signals can also be used, such as
  sigalarm
  
import signal

def ctrlc_handler(signum, frame):
    print ("Hahahaha !!! You can't kill me fucker.")

# Creating an actual signal
print ("Installing signal handler..........")
signal.signal(signal.SIGINT,ctrlc_handler)

# This will cause infinite loop
while (True):
    pass
