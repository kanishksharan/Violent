'''
variables in python: - 
They have no data type associated to them. Instead each variable is assigned to an object and that 
object has a datype.
'''
ex: -
name = "kanishk"
here the variable name has no datatype, rather the object "kanishk" is associated with a datatype "String"


Task #1:
Find the loacation where "kanishk" is stored

1. id(name)
  hex(id(name)) # gives the hexadecimal location of the string object "kanishk"

2. Method #2
  name.__repr__ # This also gives the exact same value
  
Task #2 Printing with raw string  
  name = r"kanishk\nsharan" # Printing with Raw String
  print(name) # o/p = kanishk\nsharan
  
Task #3 Printing with 3 double quotes:
  name = """
  Kesha is calling this to be a
  fun learning experience
  """
  
Task #4: unicode to str and back (It works on shell prompt in linux but this func is not available on idle)
name = u"ksha" #unicode string created
str(name) # converted unicode to normal str
unicode("Kanishk") # converting a normal string to Unicode. 
                    #Note that unicode() doesn't take variables names. It takes direct strings only within the double quotes
